# Portfolio Website

The link to the website can be found [here](www.oliverb.work).

This is a Next.js deployment, using a React/DaisyUI frontend. The previous version of my portfolio site used a Bootstrap frontend (CSS framework), the link to that repo can be found [here](https://github.com/oliverbrown1/portfolio_website_old).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
